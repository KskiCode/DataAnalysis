I found this dataset on kaggle and tried some data analysis on it basically for practice, also some visualization. Below you can find the information from the Kaggle dataset.

> Context
This dataset consists of all Netflix original films released as of June 1st, 2021. Additionally, it also includes all Netflix documentaries and specials. The data was webscraped off of this Wikipedia page, which was then integrated with a dataset consisting of all of their corresponding IMDB scores. IMDB scores are voted on by community members, and the majority of the films have 1,000+ reviews.

-> Content
Included in the dataset is (columns):
# Title of the film
# Genre of the film
# Original premiere date
# Runtime in minutes
# IMDB scores (as of 06/01/21)
# Languages currently available (as of 06/01/21)

-> Acknowledgements
Thank you to Nakul Lakhotia, whose article I used as a reference to scrape the Wikipedia tables. Here is the article I used.

-> Inspiration
I originally planned on using this data solely to make a public dashboard in Tableau, but I thought I would upload it to Kaggle in case anyone was interested in using this data. Integrating IMDB scores with this dataset was a pain, so I hope someone is able to make interesting correlations between the scores and other facets of the data.
